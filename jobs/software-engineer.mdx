## What you'll do:

- **Develop across a wide tech stack**—you'll be writing code in Rust, Go, Python, and more to build powerful, scalable systems.  
- **Ship features to production weekly**—move fast, break limits (not things), and see your work live in the wild.  
- **Work on a globally distributed system**—process billions of requests per month and tackle the challenges that come with scale.  
- **Dive deep into networking**—get hands-on with low-level concepts and understand how the internet really works.  
- **Write and share technical insights**—turn your experiences into blog posts that help the whole team (and the world) learn and grow.  

## What you are responsible for:

- **Owning what you build**—from first idea to final deployment, you'll be responsible for delivering polished, high-impact features that users rely on.  
- **Working side-by-side with the frontend team**—seamlessly integrate backend magic with user-facing experiences.  
- **Building custom integrations**—develop new features for our proprietary proxy server platform.  
- **Driving technical decisions**—help shape the architecture and toolset to keep our systems fast, resilient, and future-proof.  

## To crush it in this role, you'll need:

- **Competency with any programming language**—whether it's C, Go, Python, or anything else, you can pick up new tech quickly.  
- **A sharp eye for detail**—you notice the things others miss, and it shows in your work.  
- **Understanding and experience designing and building distributed systems** —you know how to architect scalable, resilient services that can handle massive amounts of traffic without breaking a sweat.

## You'll be a great fit if you:

- **Thrive in an in-person, high-energy environment**—we love bouncing ideas and building momentum together.  
- **Own your work like a founder**—you take full responsibility and drive projects across the finish line.  
- **Love the fast-paced startup life**—we move quickly, and you're here to keep up and push forward.  
- **Are obsessed with learning**—you dig deep, master new concepts fast, and put your knowledge to work.  
- **Have built something cool before**—a side project, an automation script, a networking tool, or anything else—show us what you've created.
