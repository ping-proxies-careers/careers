- **Level up our website and dashboard**—enhance performance, refine UX, and ship new features that make the customer experience more enjoyable.  
- **Ship mobile and desktop apps**—from iOS to Windows, you'll build cross-platform experiences that our users love to use every day.  
- **Build out our proxy tool ecosystem**—from browser extensions to fingerprint testing and automation tools, you'll help expand our suite with powerful, user-centric utilities.  

## What you are responsible for:

- **Taking ownership of the products you build**—from planning to production, you'll be responsible for delivering polished, high-impact features that users love.  
- **Leading creative designs**—collaborate closely with the team to shape intuitive, beautiful interfaces that turn complexity into clarity.  
- **Driving technical decisions**—you'll help choose the right tools, frameworks, and architectures to keep our products fast, scalable, and future-proof.

- **Experience with Next.js, React, and UIkit**—you know how to build sleek, high-performance UIs with modern tools, and you're comfortable navigating and contributing to large, complex codebases.
- **An eye for design and detail**—you bring artistic vision and good taste to everything you build, from layout to micro-interactions.  
- **Hands-on experience developing and working with APIs**—you're comfortable connecting the dots between frontend and backend.

- **Are a creative builder**—you love turning ideas into real, working products.  
- **Own your work like a founder**—no one needs to chase you down; you take full responsibility and run with it.  
- **Love working in a fast-paced team**—startups move fast, and you’re here for the ride.  
- **Are obsessed with learning**—you dive deep into new topics, master them quickly, and apply what you learn.  
- **Have built something cool before**—a side project, an app, a browser extension, a tool you couldn't find so you made it yourself—show us what you've created.
